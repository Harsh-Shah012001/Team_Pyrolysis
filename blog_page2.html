                <h3>End of Life Plastic Pollution</h3>
                Plastic. The ever-growing synthetic material is lightweight, water-resistant, durable, strong, economical, and resistant to corrosion as well as chemicals. You can find it anywhere you look, and you can’t find it if you don’t
                look. First, it doesn’t smell. Second, it’s versatile. Third, it’s cheap.7 Why wouldn’t you want to use this substance? It’s basically the stuff of gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, it’s these qualities that make plastic items antagonists of the environment, especially our dearly held waterways. This class of plastics, cleverly named “end-of-life plastics”, are becoming a larger part of the
                  constituency of our water systems. In fact, dangerous forms of plastics are turning up in alarming numbers throughout the waters of the United States. This is raising concerns about a previously unknown form of pollution that
                  scientists fear poses risks to people and wildlife by spreading toxic chemicals coupled with disease-causing bacteria.
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    End-of-life needs to be front of mind throughout product development processes.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                <h3>Plastic: A Growing Concern that Can Literally Be Eaten</h3>
                Currently, in the United States, plastic pollution is a growing concern for both individuals in affected areas and the governments that reign over them. Just look to bodies of water in the vicinity of Lake County. For example, studies
                have found that over half the plastic debris (around 5,300 metric tons) released from areas around Lake Michigan have ended up in the body of water. That’s equivalent to one hundred Olympic-sized pools full of plastic bottles. When
                using the same formula, researchers at Rochester University believe that over eight million tons of plastic will enter the oceans annually. Additionally, that rate will only increase as the years go by.
                </p>
                <p>Plastic debris also have other detrimental qualities. Floating plastics in oceans and other large bodies of water have been found to gather up persistent organic pollutants (contaminants that are hard to degrade) and transport
                  them via ocean currents.2 Plastics tend to absorb and concentrate hydrophobic contaminants from the surrounding seawater.3 Sometimes, these compounds of pollutants become so concentrated that they form gyres. Plastics are not only
                  deleterious to the appearance of our marine and aquatic ecosystems; they also have caustic effects on organisms that depend on the vitality of water.
                </p>


                <p>
                <h3>Plastic Pollution Hurts the Economy.</h3>
                Plastic pollution is in no way ambivalent to the national economy either. The United States loses a hefty amount of revenue from the tourism and fishing industry only to be compounded by the loss of nearly eleven billion dollars
                on annual litter cleanup. Often, the brunt of the cost trickles down into lower politics. The direct costs of cleanup (including beaches and waterways cleanup, street sweeping, stormwater capture devices, storm drain cleaning and
                maintenance, manual cleanup, and public education) caused West Coast communities to cough up more 520 million dollars. Doing the math, that amounts to an unnecessary $14 per year for each resident spent cleaning up marine
                litter–marine litter that could have easily been prevented.8 With such brutal stabs on the American economy, it’s a surprise why the government hasn’t started to form a plan to combat plastic pollution.

                There is a growing realization that the solution to plastic pollution in our oceans lies in using end-of-life plastics as a raw material for new production. Such principles are central to the philosophy of developing a more
                circular economy and rethinking our use of plastic materials. In line with this philosophy, it has considerable potential to bring much greater resource efficiency.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ending Single-Use Disposable Plastic Items</li>
                  <li>Deposit-Refund Systems Close the Loop</li>
                  <li>Focusing on the Responsibility of the Plastic Producers</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Greater Awareness of the End of Life Plastic Problem is Key to All Solutions</h3>
                A central idea prevails. For actions and laws to be successful, it’s important to promote greater awareness of the impacts of plastics and microplastics in the marine environment. We must take proper preparation actions. Otherwise, it
                will be more difficult to gain political agreement, public and private sector commitment, and public acceptance to pursue direct mitigation measures for litter reduction. Additionally, encouraging the introduction of the circular
                economy and the benefits of treating unwanted plastics as a resource will also be more difficult without such preparation.</p>
              <p>
                Action, to its fullest potential, won’t be possible unless we educate people around the United States as to what plastic pollution is doing to our water. This means common folk, as well as politicians. It will be more difficult to
                encourage particular key socio-economic sectors, and the public in general, to adapt their behaviors and contribute to the overall goal of reducing marine plastics.3 The crisis of plastic pollution will only be solved if we have the
                public support. It’s not possible to force people to do something and get it done efficiently.

                Going along with the idea of encouraging awareness, it’s essential to use expertise from the social sciences, including psychological studies, to better understand perceptions of risk, social responsibilities, and the drivers of
                behaviors in the public and private sectors.3 Now, the United States has done minimal investigation into what implementing plastic ban laws would do to businesses or communities at a federal level.
              </p><p>
                Certainly, it’s important to do so before taking large steps. Part of these investigations would be taking proper account of regional, cultural, gender, economic, educational, and other demographic differences, in assessing
                perceptions and behaviors.2 The United States is a nation of people with diverse attributes. Consequently, federal laws should be comprehensive enough to account for the diversity that America has.

                The plastics in our water won’t disappear any time soon, if any time at all. However, we can still preclude ourselves from an environmental disaster if we start acting now. Currently, we regulate plastic pollution in a rather lax
                manner. We should start making larger leaps toward securing safer water systems for our next generations.
