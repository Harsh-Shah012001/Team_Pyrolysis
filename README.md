# Team_Pyrolysis

**We aim to reduce the pollution and harms caused by plastic to our environment. We have three main goals:<br><br>

1.Reducing plastic dumping in our environment.<br>
2.Recycling plastic into useful fuels.<br>
3.Encouraging and linking Pyrolysis with the world<br><br>
We believe in the three R's to save our environment i.e. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.<br>
We hope that one day our ecosystem becomes plastic free and overcome from the harmful effects that plastic has caused.<br><br><br>
